# Active-Directory-Homelab-In-Promox

## Project:
The goal of this homelab was to create an Active Directory enviroment using virtual Windows 10 and Windows Server machines. I will also create a Splunk server on a virtual Ubuntu Server machine as well as a virtual Kali Linux box to simulate attacks on the Windows 10 machine. With the Splunk Universal Forwarder and Sysmon installed on the Windows machines, these attacks will generate telemetry and create events in Splunk to analyze.
